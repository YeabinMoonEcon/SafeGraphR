    This paper develops a model of the transmission of earnings, assets, and
  consumption from parents to descendants. The model assumes utility-maximizing
  parents who are concerned about the welfare of their children. The degree of
  intergenerational mobility is determined by the interaction of this
  utility-maximizing behavior with investment and consumption opportunities in
  different gene rations and with different kinds of luck. The authors examine
  a number of empirical studies for different countries. Regression to the mean
  in earnings in rich countries appears to be rapid. Almost all the earnings
  advantages or disadvantages of ancestors are wiped out in three generations.

    We quantify the lasting effects of childhood health and economic
  circumstances on adult health, employment and socioeconomic status, using
  data from a birth cohort that has been followed from birth into middle age.
  Controlling for parental income, education and social class, children who
  experience poor health have significantly lower educational attainment,
  poorer health, and lower social status as adults. Childhood health and
  circumstance appear to operate both through their impact on initial adult
  health and economic status, and through a continuing direct effect of
  prenatal and childhood health in middle age. Overall, our findings suggest
  more attention be paid to health as a potential mechanism through which
  intergenerational transmission of economic status takes place: cohort members
  born into poorer families experienced poorer childhood health, lower
  investments in human capital and poorer health in early adulthood, all of
  which are associated with lower earnings in middle age-the years in which
  they themselves become parents.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    In this article, we develop a framework for analyzing the causal effects of
  interventions in the presence of latent factors that could affect outcomes,
  even in the absence of interventions. This framework will be useful in
  situations in which genes are included among the latent factors. We estimate
  the model and study the early origins of observed later-life disparities by
  education. We determine the role played by cognitive, noncognitive, and early
  health endowments. We identify the causal effect of education on health and
  health-related behaviors. We show that family background characteristics and
  cognitive, noncognitive, and health endowments developed by age 10 are
  important determinants of health disparities at age 30. We also show that not
  properly accounting for personality traits results in overestimation of the
  importance of cognitive ability in determining later health. Selection on
  preexisting traits explains more than half of the observed differences in
  poor health and obesity. Education has an important causal effect in
  explaining differences in smoking rates. There are significant gender
  differences. We go beyond the current literature, which typically estimates
  mean effects, to compute distributions of treatment effects. We show that the
  effect of education on health varies among individuals who are similar in
  their observed characteristics, and how a mean effect can hide gains and
  losses for different individuals. This analysis highlights the crucial role
  played by promotion of good health at an early age and the importance of
  prevention in the reduction of health disparities. We speculate about how the
  model can be applied to genetic studies.%
